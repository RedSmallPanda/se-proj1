# Introduction to Git Workflow
## Some concepts
### 1. Branch
![avatar](https://sfault-image.b0.upaiyun.com/811/510/811510104-56fdfb7a1481d_articlex)
* Branch is the most important conceptof Git and the git workflow is based on branches. 
* To fix some small bugs, you dont need to create new branches, and can only fix the origin branch.
* Branches which are created for new functions are often called feature branch.

### 2. Commit
* Committing message is a kind of record of your work process. It's important for other people to understand what you are doing.</br>
</br>
* Standard for committing:</br>
  * add —— new request
  * fix —— fix bug
  * update —— update your code
  * change —— change your code
</br>
### 3. Granularity
* The appropriate granularity for a project is an independent function.
### 4. Conflict
* Since different branch is finished by different person/team, when merging branches, conflicts may occur (For example, two person changed the code of the master branch at the same time, it may cause problems.).
## Two kinds of workflow
### Centralized Workflow</br>

1. Operation Mode —— All changes are submitted to the master branch.
* Firstly, each developer will clone the master branch to his local computer and edit the code in his own project.
* Next, to release the modification, the developer should push the change to the master branch.

2. Resolving conflicts
* Before the developer push the modification, he must fetch his code with the modification of the master branch, and rebase his code on the submitting history of the master branch.(Push one's modification on the base of others' modification.)
* If conflicts occur, Git will kill the rebasing process, and you should modify your code before submitting again.

3. EXAMPLE
* Create a central repository</br>

* Each developer clones the central repository to the local repository</br>

* One developer develops the function</br>

* He push the code to the master branch on git</br>
</br>

* Another developer develops the function</br>

* She want to push the code to the master branch, but conflicts occur</br>
</br>

* She pull the modification of the first developer to her local repository, and rebase on it</br>
</br>
![avatar](https://sfault-image.b0.upaiyun.com/263/490/263490867-56fe096e556f0_articlex)

* She resolves the conflicts and successfully push her code to the master branch on git</br>

### Functional Branch Workflow</br>

1. Operation Mode —— On the base of Centralized Workflow, but opening a branch for each new feature for developing, not only on the master branch
* Also use the central repository, and the master branch represents the history of submittion.
* Open new branches for new functions.
* Those new branches should also be pushed to the central repository.
2. Pull Requests
* When a new function is finished, it should firstly be pushed to the functional branch of the central repository and initiate a pull request.
* "Pull Request" is some kind of discussion forum, in which related developers can review the code, post their feedback and even push changed code.
*  Once the "Pull Request" is accepted, what you should do to release the function is like that in  Centralized Workflow.
3. EXAMPLE
* One developer starts to develop a new function, and she need to open a new branch</br>

* She finishes the function and initiate a Pull Request</br>
</br>

* Another developer receiver the Pull Request, and discuss with she</br>
</br>

* She modify the code and push the code to the central repository, these changes can also be saw on Pull Request</br>
</br>
![avatar](https://sfault-image.b0.upaiyun.com/181/821/1818219223-56fe09a704720_articlex)

* When another developer accepts the change, she can merge branches and release the function</br>
